# SaltoTools
Tools for recording and replaying Salto sessions

*Still very much Alpha*

## Usage
With this tool it is possible to record motion from the Salto suit and replay it later.

The motiondata is timestamped (with deltas) so that the replay happens in the same speed.

It is possible to run on either another machine or the same machine as, for example, Unity.
